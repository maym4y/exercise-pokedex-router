      <p>The Pokédex (Japanese: ポケモン図鑑 illustrated Pokémon encyclopedia) is a digital encyclopedia 
        created by Professor Oak as an invaluable tool to Trainers in the Pokémon world. 
        It gives information about all Pokémon in the world that are contained in its database, 
        although it differs in how it acquires and presents information over the different media. 
        However, they are also only given to a few Trainers at a time, generally to the ones that 
        are felt to have exceptional potential and skill. Regional Pokédexes give information about 
        Pokémon native to its particular region, while the National Pokédex records information about all known Pokémon.</p>
